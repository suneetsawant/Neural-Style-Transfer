# Neural Style Transfer

This is an attempt to create an artistic image generator that recreates the input image in style of the other image. This could be also viewed as an example of using keras pretrained models with tensorflow. 

The following are the some of the results : 

<img src=/final_output/tyrion.jpeg width="240" height="300" hspace="20"/>   <img src=/final_output/athena.jpg width="240" height="300" hspace="20"/> <img src=/final_output/out_tyrion_athena.png width="240" height="300" hspace="20"/>
